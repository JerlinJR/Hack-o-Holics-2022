## How It  Works:

    ->The application has a client and moderator login with credentials already entered into the DB
    ->The client page has road type dropDown, roadName dropdown and a pit depth field.
    ->The values selected will be stored in the database.
    ->By loging into mderator page, the entered data from the client page will be displayed.
    ->According to the road type, and the length of the road, the aprox. price to repair the road will be calculated.
    ->This is accomplished by calculating the volume of damage and by using the labour and material cost of different materials used, 
      the price will be calculated.
